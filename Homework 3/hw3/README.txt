This program is at its core an audio visualizer.

Particle trails designed to emulate electric arcs grow in intensity with the music, as monolithic steel cubes rotate faster as the volume increases.

The lightning effect is produced using noise generation within particle trajectories. The trails created strongly resemble arcing current. Additionally, these emitters respond to the music.

The song currently plugged into the visualizer is Three-legged Work Horse, by This Will Destroy You. It begins with a calm intro, then moves into more percussive rock before returning to a calm outro.
