MAJOR NOTE: There was a build error that I COULD NOT SOLVE. The research on the error seems to indicate there is a
problem within Unity when using ShaderGraph with bloom, but when I tried working around it I still had the build error. Unfortunately, I spent most of my time on this project trying to fix this problem. BECAUSE of this error, the scene is currently stored in SampleScene.unity. I am working on it STILL, but if this README gets to you in this way - I still haven't fixed it.

MINOR NOTE: The newest Unity seems to cause a weird LOD error on the terrain, where the texture clips to black at certain moments.

THIS SCENE shows a tron-like glider with a Fresnel glow and post-processing bloom effect. The terrain is generated by scrolling a gradient noise heightmap, giving the illusion of flight.
