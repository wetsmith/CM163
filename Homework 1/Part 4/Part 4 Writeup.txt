The screenshot is from the game INSIDE, a brief platformer title by Playdead. Previously known for Limbo,
Playdead's two titles share a bleak, yet morbidly beautiful style.

In INSIDE, the general lighting is very soft, at the atmosphere is thick and opaque. Natural light is rare,
only occasionally breaking through the clouds or slipping through gaps in the roofing. What's peculiar, and
personally captivating, about INSIDE's aesthetic is that it's shading resembles the toon shader discussed in
class.

The effect, peculiarly, is that while the material with which objects are made of is contextually clear (for
instance the corroded metal safe) there is an undeniable clay-like or plastic-like sheen to almost everything
in the game.

There is a distinct hardness to the way edges are shaded, despite the aforementioned smooth, soft blending
of light sources. Specifically, look at the red shirt on the player. Though there is a layer of smooth,
natural light, there is also a distinct element of cel shading.

I believe the effect was achieved by blending a first pass of toon shading with a later pass of traditional,
smoother lighting. If I were to emulate the effect, I would first carefully construct my textures to not have
excessive detail. Then, I would create a very harsh cel shader, perhaps with only four regions between
a zero and one alpha value. Finally, I would pass through a more natural phong shader to achieve the final
diorama-like aesthetic. Adjust some fog values, place some depressing lights, and boom - you might have something
that resembles INSIDE.
